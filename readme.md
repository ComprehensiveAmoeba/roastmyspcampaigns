# SP Campaign Roaster üî•

An advanced Streamlit application designed to analyze and "roast" Amazon Sponsored Products bulk sheets. This tool provides a high-level overview of an account's structural health and offers actionable insights to improve performance.

## üöÄ Overview

The SP Campaign Roaster ingests a standard bulk operations file from Amazon Advertising and performs a comprehensive analysis across four key pillars of account management:

1.  **Campaign Structure:** Classifies every campaign into specific archetypes (A-J) to identify well-organized campaigns versus inefficient or messy ones.
2.  **Automation vs. Control:** Analyzes the distribution of spend between automated (Auto) and manually controlled campaigns.
3.  **Funneling & Negatives:** Measures the usage of negative keywords to determine how effectively ad spend is being protected from irrelevant searches.
4.  **Bid Adjustments:** Checks the adoption of bid-by-placement strategies, a key indicator of advanced optimization.

The app then calculates an overall account score and presents the findings in a clear, metric-driven dashboard, complete with a detailed, downloadable breakdown of every campaign.
